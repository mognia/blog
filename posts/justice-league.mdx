# Justice League

Superheroes from the DC universe consisting of Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg and I met in 2017 to spoil the party plans of Steppenwolf who tried to steal Mother Boxes on Earth.

It's a very long story of how we met each other and all thanks to Avengers who had inspired me to search for other superheroes.
